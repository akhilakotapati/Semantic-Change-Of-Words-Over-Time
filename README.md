# Semantic-Change-Of-Words-Over-Time

In this paper, we have implemented several models to analyze statistically significant linguistic shifts. We have analyzed how the co-occurrence changes over time, how the state of the entity is influenced by this change and how this corresponds to the events occurring in same period.
First, we have implemented word embed- ding models such as Word2Vec and GloVe. Through this approach, we compute the vector representation of words, from the given corpus, for each time period. Then, vector spaces are projected on to one unified coordinate system. Second, we have implemented a generative probabilistic model to find relationships among data, text documents. This is executed using a Topic modeling method called, Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
Through these analysis we would like to show that the Topic model infer word embedding trajectories are more interpretable and lead to higher predictive likelihoods than competing static models that are trained separately on time slices.
